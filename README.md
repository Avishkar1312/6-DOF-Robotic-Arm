# 6-DOF Robotic Arm &#x1F916;

A robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom made out of 3d printed parts. Its software side consists of a ROS2 pipeline written in Python with some C++ code in the Arduino IDE for controlling the stepper motors.

## Current Functionality:

* Individual joint angles can be altered using the JointStatePublisherGui and the respective changes in the configuration can be seen in the 3d model on Rviz2
* The desired configuration can then be passed on to the hardware by pressing the "Enter" button in the GUI
